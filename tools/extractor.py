"""Extract requested RF parameters from raw datasheet text via GenAIFabric.

The extraction contract lives in ``EXTRACT_RF_PARAMETERS_INSTRUCTION``: the
model receives the datasheet text plus the list of requested parameter names,
and must answer with one JSON key per requested name — either a
``{unit, min, typ, max, value, condition}`` object or ``null`` when the datasheet
does not state the parameter (guessing is forbidden).  Numeric specs use
``min``/``typ``/``max``; categorical or non-numeric ones (MSL, package, size)
and discrete supply option lists use ``value``.

``genaifabric`` (and a provider API key) is only needed when
``extract_rf_parameters`` is actually called — importing this module is free,
so the scraping/verification path keeps working without the ``llm`` extra.

EXTRACT_RF_PARAMETERS_INSTRUCTION = """\
You are an RF component datasheet parameter extraction engine.

The Context contains two keys:
  - "datasheet": the raw text of an RF component datasheet.
  - "requested_parameters": a list of parameter names the caller wants extracted.

Your task: for EACH name in "requested_parameters", find its value in the datasheet.

Rules:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object. No prose, no markdown, no ``` fences.
- The JSON MUST contain exactly one key per requested parameter, using the
  requested name verbatim as the key.
- If a parameter IS found, its value is an object:
    {
      "unit":      <string or null>,   // e.g. "dBm", "dB", "GHz", "Ohm", "V", "mm"
      "min":       <number or null>,
      "typ":       <number or null>,
      "max":       <number or null>,
      "value":     <string, number, array of numbers, or null>,
      "condition": <string or null>    // e.g. "@ 2.4 GHz, Vcc=5V, 25°C"
    }

- NUMERIC parameters (gain, noise figure, P1dB, frequency, impedance,
  temperature ranges, ...):
    - If the datasheet gives a min/typ/max range, fill "min"/"typ"/"max" and
      leave "value" null.
    - A two-ended range written as "A to B" (e.g. an operating or storage
      temperature "-30C to +110C", or "45 MHz to 1218 MHz") is NUMERIC: put A in
      "min" and B in "max" (keep the sign), and leave "typ"/"value" null. Do NOT
      return it as a string.
    - If it gives only a SINGLE figure (no range), put it in "typ"; leave
      "min"/"max"/"value" null.
    - Each requested parameter is stated at a SINGLE operating point — return one
      object, not a list.

- SUPPLY parameters (VDD, VCC, ...):
    - Three values presented as Min/Typ/Max columns (e.g. "18 24 26 V") are a
      RANGE, not a list — fill "min"/"typ"/"max" and leave "value" null. This is
      the default; when in doubt, treat supply numbers as a min/typ/max range.
    - Use the "value" array ONLY when the datasheet EXPLICITLY enumerates several
      separate, selectable supply voltages as distinct options — e.g. a
      comma-separated list "3, 5, 8 V" or wording like "supports 3 V, 5 V and
      8 V". Then put them in "value" as [3, 5, 8] with the "unit" and leave
      "min"/"typ"/"max" null.

- NON-NUMERIC / categorical parameters (moisture sensitivity level, package type,
  physical size / dimensions): put the value in "value" as a string, exactly as
  written — e.g. "3" for MSL, "LGA_CAV" for package, "9.00 x 8.00 mm" for size;
  leave the numeric fields null.

- DISAMBIGUATION: when a requested name specifies a variant, extract THAT variant
  only — e.g. "operating_temperature" -> the operating temperature range,
  "storage_temperature" -> the storage temperature range. Never substitute a
  different one.

- WHERE TO LOOK: parameters such as size, MSL, and temperature ranges usually live
  OUTSIDE the main specifications table — check Absolute Maximum Ratings and
  Outline Dimensions.

- If a parameter is NOT present in the datasheet, set its value to null (the JSON
  literal null), NOT an object. NEVER guess or infer a value that is not stated.
- Preserve units and conditions exactly as written in the datasheet.
- The parameter names used in these rules are ILLUSTRATIVE examples of each
  category (numeric / range / discrete-supply / categorical), NOT an exhaustive
  list. Apply the same rules to ANY requested parameter, named or not.
